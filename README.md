Non-file changes
----------------
- 3/26 - projects/html5game/ directory checks 'Referer' header to prevent direct file links (403).
- 3/26 - surveillance/cams/  directory checks 'Referer' header to prevent direct file links (403).

New files were placed in the game shortly before direct linking was blocked. This could easily mean cams/ folder will contain hints later.

- 3/28 - The php error_log files that were in multiple directories now 403.
- 3/28 - worm/*.html links 403 for no apparent reason, no other directory does this.

Latest News
