Will be updated as anyone finds new files

Other Noteworthy changes:
- 3/26 - projects/html5game/ directory checks 'Referer' header to prevent direct file links (403).
- 3/26 - surveillance/cams/  directory checks 'Referer' header to prevent direct file links (403).
- 3/28 - The php error_log files that were in multiple directories now 403.


There were new files placed in the game, and we were supposed to play the game to find it but didn't. This could easily mean camera folder will contain hints later.
