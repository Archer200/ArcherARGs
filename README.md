# algersoft.net ARG
Copy of the current algersoft ARG site
Will be updated as anyone finds new files


Other Noteworthy changes that went live shortly after 3/26:
- projects/html5game/ directory checks 'Referer' header to prevent direct file links.
- surveillance/cams/  directory checks 'Referer' header to prevent direct file links.
There were new files placed in the game, and we were supposed to play the game to find it but didn't. This could easily mean camera folder will contain hints later.
